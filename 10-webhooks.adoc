## SCM Web Hooks

:data-uri:

OpenShift offers several mechanisms to trigger the automatic deployment
of applications. In this Lab, we will demonstrate the deployment of a
very simple application via WebHook trigger.



In this section of the Lab we will:

* Create a new project.
* Deploy an application using a source to image strategy.
* Create a route to expose the newly deployed application.

### Create new project

IMPORTANT: Please replace *userxx* with the username assigned to you in
the commands below.

----
$ oc new-project scm-web-hooks-userxx --display-name="Test WebHooks"
----

### Create new application

. Login into Gogs using your same credentials: {{GIT_SERVER_URL}}.
. Click in the plus sign in the right top corner menu, then click on *New Migration*.
. In the *Clone Address* use `https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/bluegreen.git`
. Use `bluegreen` as *Repository Name*.

IMPORTANT: Please replace *userxx* with the username assigned to you in
the commands below.

----
$ oc new-app --image-stream=php --code={{GIT_SERVER_URL}}/userxx/bluegreen.git --name=scm-web-hooks
----

### Look at some of the created resources

* Build configuration

----
$ oc get bc
----

* Deployment configuration

----
$ oc get dc
----

* Show created service

----
$ oc get service
----

* Show replication controller

----
$ oc get rc
----

* Show route

----
$ oc get route
----

Notice that there is no route created yet for this application.

Show the builds in progress (Running):

----
$ oc get builds
NAME              TYPE      STATUS    POD
scm-web-hooks-1   Source    Running   scm-web-hooks-1-build
----

Monitor the build:

----
$ oc logs build/scm-web-hooks-1
----

The build should finish similar to:

----
Pushing image docker-registry.default.svc:5000/scm-web-hooks-userxx/scm-web-hooks:latest ...
Pushed 0/6 layers, 1% complete
Pushed 1/6 layers, 20% complete
Pushed 2/6 layers, 36% complete
Pushed 3/6 layers, 50% complete
Push successful
----

### Create a route

----
$ oc get service

NAME            TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)             AGE
scm-web-hooks   ClusterIP   172.30.46.189   <none>        8080/TCP,8443/TCP   2m
----

IMPORTANT: Please replace *userxx* with the username assigned to you in
the commands below.

----
$ oc expose service scm-web-hooks --hostname=scm-web-hooks.userxx.{{APPS_ADDRESS}}
NAME            HOST/PORT                                  PATH      SERVICE         LABELS              TLS TERMINATION
scm-web-hooks   scm-web-hooks.userxx.{{APPS_ADDRESS}}             scm-web-hooks   app=scm-web-hooks
----

*Step 5: Test the application*

* Use the newly created route, in the above case
`scm-web-hooks.userxx.{{APPS_ADDRESS}}` and paste it in your browser.
* You should see something similar to:

image::blue_deployment.jpeg[image]

At this point you have an application with one single replica running
inside a docker container in OpenShift. We used the source retrieved
from the git repository and layered it using a builder or image stream
strategy, in this particular case, the php image stream.

In this part of the Lab we will:

* Create a web hook for the recently deployed application.
* Make a small change to the application.
* Test to make sure the application was re-deployed.

### Retrieve the OpenShift Web Hook URL

* Navigate to the OpenShift Web console and login.
* Select your *Test WebHooks* project, and click *Builds* and then
*Builds*.
* Click onto the build name from the list. You should have just one in
this case.
* Click *Configuration* tab to get list of *Triggers* for the Generic Webhook link.
* Copy the *Generic Webhook URL*. You will need this URL for next step.

### Configure Gogs repository Webhook

* Login to your Gogs account.
* Click on the `bluegreen` project.
* Click on *Settings -> Webhooks*.
* Click on *Add Webhook* and select *Gogs*.
* Add the recently copied Webhook URL from OpenShift into *Payload URL*.
* Confirm by clicking the *Add Webhook* button in green at the bottom of
the page.


### Redeploy the application

* Edit in your Gogs `bluegreen` repository the `image.php` file from the web interface in Gogs.
* Remove the line 5 that has this comment: `// Line reserved to trigger the webhook in the lab.`
* Commit the file.

### Monitor new deployment process

* After saving/committing the `image.php` file with the small change,
you'll notice in the OpenShift Web Console that a new build process has
been automatically triggered.

NOTE: You didn't have to start a build yourself.

* Monitor the build process using:

----
$ oc get builds

$ oc logs build/scm-web-hooks-2
----


### Summary

We have shown in this Lab how simple it is to configure automatic
deployments of applications using OpenShift and Gogs Webhook
triggers.
