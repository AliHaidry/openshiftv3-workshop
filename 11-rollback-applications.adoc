## Rollback Applications


:data-uri:

In this lab we will see how we can rollback an application in OpenShift
quickly without switching to an older version of the source code in SCM.

In this Lab we will:

* Use the same app we deployed in the previous exercise.
* Rollback the application using the OpenShift v3 command "rollback".

### Check application health status

* Run:

----
$ oc get pods

NAME                    READY     STATUS       RESTARTS   AGE
scm-web-hooks-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          1h
scm-web-hooks-2-85bkw   1/1       Running     0          18m
scm-web-hooks-2-build   0/1       Completed   0          19m
----

* Inspecting the output of the above command we can see that we have a
single replica of the previously deployed application running.
* We can also see that previously two pods were used to build the
application.
* You can also use:

----
$ oc get dc

NAME            REVISION   DESIRED   CURRENT   TRIGGERED BY
scm-web-hooks   2          1         1         config,image(scm-web-hooks:latest)
----

* The latest and active version for the application is *2*
* If we display the application in the browser we see something similar to:

### Changing the application

We can change the environment variable that defines the color so we will trigger a new deployment to make the application draw a green square.

To change to green just change the variable:

----
$ oc set env dc/scm-web-hooks COLOR=green
----

This step will trigger a new deployment, we can check it by doing:

----
$ oc get dc

NAME            REVISION   DESIRED   CURRENT   TRIGGERED BY
scm-web-hooks   3          1         1         config,image(scm-web-hooks:latest)
----

Open the application url and you should be able to see a green square now.

### Rollback the application

* Using the previous command we ran to retrieve the deployment
configuration, we will revert or rollback to version 2.

----
$ oc rollback scm-web-hooks --to-version=2
#4 rolled back to scm-web-hooks-2
----

* If we re-run the command to list the build configurations, we now see:

----
$ oc get dc

NAME            REVISION   DESIRED   CURRENT   TRIGGERED BY
scm-web-hooks   4          1         1         config,image(scm-web-hooks:latest)
----

* So OpenShift has rolled back the application to version 1 and created
a new build configuration.
* Reloading the application now displays:
