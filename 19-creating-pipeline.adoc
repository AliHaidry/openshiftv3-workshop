### Creating a Pipeline


In this lab, we will learn to create a build pipeline on OpenShift. This
pipeline will be setup using Jenkins running as an application pod on
OpenShift. The pipeline running on Jenkins will trigger builds and
deployments on OpenShift.

*Prerequisites:* You need a github account if you want to make changes
and test the pipeline kick-off.

*Step 1:* Create a new project Create a new project with name
`pipeline-UserName`.

NOTE: _Substitute UserName with your own user name._

*Step 2:* Deploy your CI/CD tool (Jenkins)

Click on `Add to Project` on the Web console, and navigate to
`Import YAML / JSON` tab.

In the text box with heading
`Upload file by dragging & dropping, selecting it, or pasting from the clipboard`,
copy and paste the Build Configuration the following Build Configuration
and press on `Create`.

....
apiVersion: v1
kind: BuildConfig
metadata:
  name: myfirstpipeline
  labels:
    name: myfirstpipeline
  annotations:
    pipeline.alpha.openshift.io/uses: '[{"name": "myphp", "namespace": "", "kind": "DeploymentConfig"}]'
spec:
  triggers:
    -
      type: GitHub
      github:
        secret: secret101
    -
      type: Generic
      generic:
        secret: secret101
  runPolicy: Serial
  source:
    type: None
  strategy:
    type: JenkinsPipeline
    jenkinsPipelineStrategy:
      jenkinsfile: "node() {\nstage 'build'\nopenshiftBuild(buildConfig: 'myphp', showBuildLogs: 'true')\nstage 'deploy'\nopenshiftDeploy(deploymentConfig: 'myphp')\nopenshiftScale(deploymentConfig: 'myphp',replicaCount: '2')\n}"
  output:
  resources:
  postCommit:
....

Note that the build configuration uses `JenkinsPipelineStrategy`. Also
the `spec.strategy.jenkinsPipelineStrategy.jenkinsfile` is the actual
pipeline that runs. We will discuss that in the next step.

This will spin up a Jenkins pod. Give it a few minutes as it takes time
to download and deploy jenkins. You will also see the URL assigned to
your Jenkins. It would be something like
`https://jenkins-pipeline-UserName.{{APPS_ADDRESS}}`

If you click on that URL, you will be taken to Jenkins Console.

NOTE: The browser may complain that the URL is insecure. Click on advanced and
proceed to url and accept the certificate.

At the next step, choose `Login with OpenShift` and enter your openshift
credentials to login.

On the next screen, allow all `Requested Permissions`

Now you will be taken to Jenkins console (that is running on OpenShift).

*Step 3:* Understand the pipeline

Using left menu on the Web Console, select `Builds`->`Pipelines`. You
will see that `myfirstpipeline` is created. Click on that.

Since we haven't run the pipeline yet, the `History` tab shows nothing.
If you click on the `Configuration` tab, you will see the build
configuration details.

NOTE: There are webhook urls on this page. We will come back to this
and use after a couple of steps.

Review the `Jenkinsfile` on this page.

* It has two stages `build` and `deploy`.

* In the `build` stage the `openshiftBuild` plugin is used to trigger a
build named `myphp`.

* In the `deploy` stage the `openshiftDeploy` plugin invokes a
deployment configuration `myphp` and then invokes `openshiftScale`
plugin to scale up the same deployment configuration to 2 replicas.

This means that we need a build configuration and deployment
configuration for our application, but we want these triggered by our
pipeline (not auto-triggered by default). So let us create an
application `myphp` with the build configuration and deployment
configuration so that we can trigger it using this Jenkins pipeline.

*Step 4:* Create an application

Click on `Add to Project` -> `Browse Catalog` -> `Languages` and then look for `PHP`.

We will use `myphp` as the application name.

NOTE: Same name will be used for BuildConfig and DeployConfig by default.

You can use link:https://github.com/VeerMuchandi/bluegreen[] application to test the pipeline.

Now click on the link `Advanced Options`. It will open up a bunch of
options and we will edit those. Under the section `Build Configuration`,
*uncheck* all the three check boxes for the following options:

* Configure a webhook build trigger.
* Automatically build a new image when the builder image changes.
* Launch the first build when the build configuration is created.

By unchecking these, we are disabling the start of the builds as we want
to control those using pipeline.

In the section `Deployment Configuration`, *uncheck* the two auto-deploy options:

* New image is available
* Deployment configuration changes

By unchecking these, we are disabling the start of the deployments as we want to control those using pipeline.

Now scroll down and click on the `Create` button.

This will create the required objects (build configuration, deployment
configuration, imagestream, service and route) but won't start a build.

*Step 5:* Start pipeline

Now click on the `Start Pipeline` button to start the pipeline.

Notice the pipeline starts and `build` and `deploy` stages are executed.

image::pipeline3.jpeg[image]

Click on the `View log` link for the pipeline. It'll take you to Jenkins
and show the logs.

In a couple of minutes, the `build` and `deploy` will complete, and your
applicaiton will be deployed and scaled to 2 replicas. Now use the
application to notice that the `blue` box is displayed.

*Bonus Points*: Watch the videos here
https://blog.openshift.com/create-build-pipelines-openshift-3-3/ and
understand how to create a pipeline that goes across multiple projects.

Congratulations!! In this lab, you have learnt how to set up and run
your own CI/CD pipeline on OpenShift.
