## Creating an application using JBoss EAP builder image

:data-uri:

In this exercise we will learn how to create an application using source
code and the JBoss EAP builder image.

### Create a project or use an existing project

If you want to, you can create a new project based on what you have
learned in previous labs. Or you can create a new project for JBoss
Applications.

IMPORTANT: Please replace *userxx* with the username assigned to you in
the commands below.

----
$ oc new-project myjbossapp-userxx --display-name="My JBoss Applications" --description="A place for my JBoss EAP Applications"
----

### Create an application that uses the JBoss EAP builder image

We will be using a sample application called *Kitchensink* (found
https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-quickstarts[here]). Taking that
source-code; we will use the JBoss `ImageStream` (or the builder image) to
assemble our application.

Open the browser and select your new project *My JBoss Applications*.

Click into *Add to Project* button.

In the search text box type `eap` and select the *JBoss EAP 6.4 (no https)*.

Click on *Next >* button.

Fill the fields with the following information:

[width="50%",options="header"]
|=========================================================
|Attribute Name     |Value
|Application Name   |ks
|Maven mirror url   |{{NEXUS_URL}}
|=========================================================

NOTE: Besides the changes we've made in this previous step we'll keep the defaults to all the other fields.

Click on *Next >* and keep the default at the *Binding* step, then click on *Create*.

Click on *Close*.

### Build

Give it some seconds and you will see OpenShift starts the build process
for you. You can view the list of builds using `oc get builds` command.

----
$ oc get builds

NAME      TYPE      FROM          STATUS     STARTED         DURATION
ks-1      Source    Git@50ea6f4   Complete   2 minutes ago   24s
----

Note the name of the build that is running i.e. `ks-1`. We will use that
name to look at the build logs. Run the command as shown below to look
at the build logs. This will run for a few mins. At the end you will
notice that the docker image is successfully created and it will start
pushing this to OpenShift internal docker registry.

----
$ oc get pods

NAME         READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
ks-1-build   1/1       Running   0          11m
----

We can check the logs by executing the following command:

----
$ oc logs pod/ks-1-build

----

You will notice that in the logs that not only does it copy your source
code to the builder image, but it also does a `maven` build to compile
your code as well. Also, in the above log, note how the image is pushed
to the local docker registry.

### Deployment

Once the image is pushed to the docker registry, OpenShift will trigger
a deploy process. Let us also quickly look at the deployment
configuration by running the following command. Note `dc` represents
`deploymentconfig`.

Note where the image is picked from. It shows that the deployment picks
the image from the local registry and the image tag is the same as what we built earlier.
This means the deployment step deploys the application image what was
built earlier during the build step.

If you get the list of pods, you'll notice that the application gets
deployed quickly and starts running in its own pod.

----
$ oc get pods

NAME         READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
ks-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          21m
ks-1-vvbn5   1/1       Running     0          18m
----

### Adding a route

This step is very much the same as what we did in previous exercises. We
will check the service and add a route to expose that service.

----
$ oc get service ks

NAME      TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
ks        ClusterIP   172.30.142.190   <none>        8080/TCP   22m
----

Route should be already created.

----
$ oc get routes

NAME      HOST/PORT                                                      PATH      SERVICES   PORT      TERMINATION   WILDCARD
ks        ks-myjbossapp-userxx.apps.verizon-e346.openshiftworkshop.com             ks         <all>                   None
----

If route does not show, we expose the service `ks` via the command
below.

----
$ oc expose service ks

route "ks" exposed
----

And now we can check the route uri.

### Running the application

Now access the application by using the route you got in the previous
step.

IMPORTANT: Please replace *userxx* with the username assigned to you.

Go to https://ks-myjbossapp-userxx.{{APPS_ADDRESS}} via your browser.

Congratulations! In this exercise you have learned how to create, build
and deploy a JBoss EAP application using OpenShift's JBoss EAP Builder
Image.
