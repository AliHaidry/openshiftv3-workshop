## Scale up, Scale down and Idle the application instances

:data-uri:

In this exercise we will learn how to scale our application. OpenShift
has the capability to scale your application and make sure that many
instances are always running.

### Switch to an existing project

IMPORTANT: Please replace *userxx* with the username assigned to you in
the commands below.

For this exercise, we will be using an already running application. We
will be using the `mycliproject-userxx` that you created in the
previous labs. Make sure you are switched to that project by using the
`oc project` command.

----
$ oc project mycliproject-userxx
----

### View the deployment config

Take a look at the `deploymentConfig` (or `dc`) of the `time`
application:

----
$ oc get deploymentConfig/dockerbuildapp -o yaml

  unavailableReplicas: 0
  updatedReplicas: 1
----

Note that the `replicas:` is set to `1`. This tells OpenShift that when
this application deploys, make sure that there is 1 instance.

The `replicationController` mirrors this configuration initially; the
`replicationController` (or `rc`) will ensure that there is always the
set number of instances always running.

To view the `rc` for your application first get the current pod running.

----
$ oc get pods

NAME                     READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
dockerbuildapp-1-9b2kc   1/1       Running     0          1h
dockerbuildapp-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          1h
----

This shows that the build `dockerbuildapp-1` is running in pod `9b2kc`. Let's
view the `rc` on this build.

----
$ oc get rc/dockerbuildapp-1

NAME               DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
dockerbuildapp-1   1         1         1         1h
----

NOTE: You can change the number of replicas in `DeploymentConfig` or
the `ReplicationController`.

However note that if you change the `deploymentConfig` it applies to
your application. This means, even if you delete the current replication
controller, the new one that gets created will be assigned the REPLICAS
value based on what is set for DC. If you change it on the Replication
Controller, the application will scale up. But if you happen to delete
the current replication controller for some reason, you will loose that
setting.

### Scale Application

To scale your application we will edit the `deploymentConfig` to 3.

Open your browser to the Overview page and note you only have one
instance running.

image::scale_updown_overview.png[image]

Now scale your application using the `oc scale` command (remembering to
specify the `dc`)

----
$ oc scale --replicas=3 dc/dockerbuildapp

deploymentconfig "dockerbuildapp" scaled
----

If you look at the web console and you will see that there are 3
instances running now
image::scale_updown_overview_scaled.png[image]

NOTE: You can also scale up and down from the web console by going to
the project overview page and clicking twice on up arrow right next to the pod count circle to
add 2 more pods.

On the command line, see how many pods you are running now:

----
$ oc get pods

NAME                     READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
dockerbuildapp-1-4pqf7   1/1       Running     0          2m
dockerbuildapp-1-9b2kc   1/1       Running     0          15m
dockerbuildapp-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          15m
dockerbuildapp-1-krpbq   1/1       Running     0          2m
----

You now have 3 instances of `dockerbuildapp-1` running (each with a different
pod-id). If you check the `rc` of the `dockerbuildapp-1` build you will see that
it has been updated by the `dc`.

----
$ oc get rc/dockerbuildapp-1

NAME               DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
dockerbuildapp-1   3         3         3         15m
----

### Idling the application

Run the following command to find the available endpoints:

----
$ oc get endpoints

NAME             ENDPOINTS                                                   AGE
dockerbuildapp   10.1.10.36:8443,10.1.2.38:8443,10.1.4.33:8443 + 3 more...   16m
----

Note that the name of the endpoints is `dockerbuildapp` and there are three IP
addresses for the three pods.

Run the following command to idle the application:

----
$ oc idle endpoints/dockerbuildapp

The service "mycliproject-userxx/dockerbuildapp" has been marked as idled
The service will unidle DeploymentConfig "mycliproject-userxx/dockerbuildapp" to 3 replicas once it receives traffic
DeploymentConfig "mycliproject-userxx/dockerbuildapp" has been idled
----

Go back to the Web Console. You will notice that the pods show up as
idled.

image::idled_pods.png[image]

At this point the application is idled, the pods are not running and no
resources are being used by the application. This doesn't mean that the
application is deleted. The current state is just saved that's all.

### Reactivate your application

Click on the application route URL or access the application via curl.

Note that it takes a little while for the application to respond. This
is because pods are spinning up again. You can notice that in the web
console.

In a little while the output comes up and your application would be up
with 3 pods.

So, as soon as the user accesses the application, it comes up!!!

*Step 7: Scaling Down*

Scaling down is the same procedure as scaling up. Use the `oc scale`
command on the `time` application `dc` setting.

----
$ oc scale --replicas=1 dc/dockerbuildapp

deploymentconfig "dockerbuildapp" scaled
----

Alternately, you can go to project overview page and click on
down arrow twice to remove 2 running pods.

Congratulations!! In this exercise you have learned about scaling and
how to scale up/down your application on OpenShift!
